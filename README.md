## Project Description

"Revolutionizing the blue-collar industry in Kenya with a centralized web app connecting handymen to clients."

Our project is a blue-collar web app designed to connect skilled handymen with potential clients in Kenya. By providing a centralized platform for booking and scheduling services, along with a verification process to ensure the trustworthiness of handymen, our app addresses the problem of unemployment and underemployment among handymen while also providing a convenient and reliable service for clients.
